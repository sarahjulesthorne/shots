Exercise in modules and Webpack
## Description  
Project was an exercise in the use of modules and Webpack as our task runner.  
We completed the first two sections of this project in class, the movies and locations display and the locations filtering functionality.  
We created the singleMovie view on our own.  
I had to problem solve some circular dependency issues between modules.  
I also solved some issues regarding calling functions before they were initialized, but I later refactored that problem/solution out of my project.  
Styling is not gorgeous for the home view, but was the part we did in class/with teachers, so less essential as part of my personal assignment.
